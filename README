Object-I18n version 0.02
========================

This is an alpha release, meaning the API is subject to change.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To run the Class::DBI tests, fill in the values in t/lib/dbi_connect.pl
with something that can be used for testing.

DEPENDENCIES

None, but it was primarily written for use with Class::DBI.
It is more generic, though, so please use it with your other objects
and contribute an Object::I18n::Storage class if you have one.
